## 2.1.3 Exercise

 > **Question 1**: What are the six types of atomic vector? How does a list
 differ from an atomic vector?

The four common types (ordered from least flexible to most):

1. logical
1. integer
1. double
1. character

And two rather special types

5) raw
6) complex

Atomic vectors can only contain one type of input. Lists are vectors too:

```{r}
l <- list("a" = 1:10, "b" = c("a1", "b1"))
is.vector(l)
```

The difference between atomic vectors and list is that the latter may contain
different input types.

 > **Question 2**: What makes `is.vector()` and `is.numeric()` fundamentally 
 different to `is.list()` and `is.character()`?
