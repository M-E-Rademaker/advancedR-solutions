## AdvancedR-Solutions

This is an collection of solutions to selected exercises from 
[Hadley Wickhams](https://github.com/hadley) book 
[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) (as of June 2015). Of course, there is no 
guarantee that my solutions are correct nor do they always present the most 
efficient way of doing things.

Please fell free to comment or correct anything that you think is wrong or 
somehow noteworthy (by writing an issue or by sending a pull request).
